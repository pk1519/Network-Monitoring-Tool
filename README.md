# Network Latency Monitor
This project is a real-time network latency monitoring tool that pings a list of hosts or IP addresses and displays their connectivity status, latency, success rate, jitter, and more. It provides visual updates on the status of each host using Rich's live table formatting in the console.

# Features
Real-time Ping Monitoring: Continuously pings specified hosts to gather latency data.
Success Rate and Jitter Calculation: Calculates the success rate and jitter for each host.
Average Latency Tracking: Provides insights into average latency changes.
Hostname Resolution: Displays resolved hostnames if available.
Supports CIDR and IP Ranges: Expands CIDR and IP ranges for bulk host tracking.

# Prerequisites
Python 3.7 or higher
The following Python packages:
ping3 (for performing pings)
rich (for live table updates in the console)

# How To Run
first download Hosta.txt file then run the code
